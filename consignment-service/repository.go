// Close closes the database session after each query has ran.
// Mgo creates a 'master' session on start-up, it's then good practice
// to copy a new session for each request that's made. This means that
// each request has its own database session. This is safer and more efficient,
// as under the hood each session has its own database socket and error handling.
// Using one main database socket means requests having to wait for that session.
// I.e this approach avoids locking and allows for requests to be processed concurrently. Nice!
// But... it does mean we need to ensure each session is closed on completion. Otherwise
// you'll likely build up loads of dud connections and hit a connection limit. Not nice!
